small:  My favorite recent hindi song. A rough translation of my favorite part (the beginning) would be "What kind of selfishness is this of yours? You can't pick sun or shade. What kind of selfishness is this of yours? (Your) feet don't rest anywhere. You've become your own god, you swam seven seas. Yet (your) thoughts are dry, Why?"
