small:  my dad sent me this in a text some time back and I didn't pay much attention. The part at 1:50 is pretty and roughly translates to "This village's uneducated soil cannot read your letter. This soil if you come and kiss, will make this earth's heart happy. Understood that you have some dreams but we are your own. Forgetful you, your memory haunts us." My dad is a romantic as you can probably tell by now.
