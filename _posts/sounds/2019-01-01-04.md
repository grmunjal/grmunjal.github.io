small: Cox is one of my favorite recent (to me) figures for his science communication skills. Mainly because the "fascinating" aspect of science is one I find hard to express with my non-science peers and he does a great job of it. His reading of Carl Sagan's Pale Blue Dot (roughly at 13:34 here) is great!
