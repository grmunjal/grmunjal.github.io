<br>
<div id="aboutbook">
"<em>The Big Red Book </em>is a poetic masterpiece from Jalaluddin Rumi, the medieval Sufi mystic whom <em>Time </em>magazine calls "the most popular poet in America." Readers continue to be awed and inspired by Rumi’s masterfully lyrical, deeply expressive poems, collected in volumes such as <em>The Illustrated Rumi</em>, <em>The Soul of Rumi</em>, and the bestselling <em>The Essential Rumi</em>. With <em>The Big Red Book</em>, acclaimed poet and Rumi interpreter Coleman Barks offers a never-before-published translation of a crucial anthology of poems widely considered to be one of Persian literature’s greatest treasures." <br>

<br>
<div id="aboutbook">
"In his second collection of stories, as in his first, Carver's characters are peripheral people-people without education, insight or prospects, people too unimaginative to even give up. Carver celebrates these men and women." ~ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Talk-About-When-Love/dp/0679723056">(Amazon)</a>

<small>His writing style took some time (the first few stories) for me to get used to. I found myself going "what?!" at the end of almost every single story but the abrupt endings and the banality of the settings are some things I came to like and appreciate a lot. My favorite story in here is called "So Much Water So Close to Home. <a href="https://beta.prx.org/stories/42401">Here's</a> him reading the title story.</small>

Gadget by Jaron Lanier</a></h2>
<br>
<div id="aboutbook">
Mr. Lanier, a pioneer in the development of virtual reality and a Silicon Valley veteran, is hardly a Luddite, as some of his critics have suggested. Rather he is a digital-world insider who wants to make the case for "a new digital humanism" before software engineers’ design decisions, which he says fundamentally shape users’ behavior, become "frozen into place by a process known as lock-in." Just as decisions about the dimensions of railroad tracks determined the size and velocity of trains for decades to come, he argues, so choices made about software design now may yield "defining, unchangeable rules" for generations to come.<br>

"This book marries a child's wonder to a genius's intellect. We journey into Hawking's universe while marvelling at his mind." ~The Sunday Times (London)

"Lively and provocative...Mr. Hawking clearly possesses a natural teacher's gifts-easy, good-natured humor and an ability to illustrate highly complex propositions with analogies plucked from daily life." ~The New York Times

<small>I recently re-read my crummy copy right before watching "Interstellar" and "The Theory of Everything", I highly recommend doing the same for all cosmology fans</small>

<h2><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dGSj-CFxk-QC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false">Hybrid by Noel Kingsbury</a></h2>
<br>
<div id="aboutbook">
"In plant breeding, just as in evolution, genetic variety is the raw material of success. Hybrid is the story of how the genes that make a fat corn cob, a luscious apple, a brilliantly orange carrot or a high yielding strain of rice have traveled by serpentine paths to reach the genomes of the crops that we so depend on and yet so take for granted. In Hybrid we learn that there was a green revolution in eleventh-century China when a visionary emperor imported new strains of rice from Indochina; how working men in nineteenth-century Britain made a sport of competitive gooseberry breeding, and how a German doctor discovered hybrid vigor in plants. Hybrid the book displays, like hybrids themselves, all the marvelous fruit of miscellany."
